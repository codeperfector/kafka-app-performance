# Demo project for Kafka App Performance
This is an example project intended to be used as a demo to explore kafka related concerns, examining details with prometheus metrics. I struggled a bit to find good resources online to setup a simple kafka producer and consumer in minikube with prometheus metrics. Setting up prometheus can be really challenging as there are so many knobs. Eventually I found a way to set things up without diving too deep into prometheus giving me what I need.
